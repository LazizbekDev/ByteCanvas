This is a simple landing page for a blog website. It features a few articles about technology, programming, and 3D modeling. The code is written in JavaScript and uses the Express framework.

To run the server, first install the dependencies by running the following command in the terminal:

```
npm install
```

Then, start the server by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

The server will be running on port 5000. You can access the landing page by visiting http://localhost:5000/ in your browser.

The code for the landing page is located in the `server/public/index.html` file. This file contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the page.

The code for the API routes is located in the `server/routes/posts.js` file. This file contains the Express router for the API.

The code for the controller is located in the `server/controller/posts/postController.js` file. This file contains the logic for the API routes.

I hope this helps!
